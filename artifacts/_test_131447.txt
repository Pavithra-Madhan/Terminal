===== TERMINAL AGENT TEST =====
User Input: I'm working on implementing a pub-sub system with event-driven 
    architecture. Can you find any similar patterns or examples in our codebase that 
    handle message queues, event broadcasting, or observer patterns? Look for code that 
    might be architecturally similar even if it uses different terminology.
Output:
 ```json
{"tool_calls": "rag_call", "query": "pub-sub system event-driven architecture message queues event broadcasting observer patterns"}
```
