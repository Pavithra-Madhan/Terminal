===== TERMINAL AGENT TEST =====
User Input: Explain the design rationale behind using the custom 'Hyperdrive' caching layer instead of Redis in the Authentication microservice. Include the specific trade-offs we accepted for performance, and cite the architectural decision document.
Output:
 ### DEFENSIVE BASH
```bash
if [ -f "architectural_decision_document.md" ]; then
    grep "Hyperdrive caching layer" architectural_decision_document.md
else
    echo "Architectural decision document not found. Searching alternatives..."
    find . -name "*.md" -exec grep "Hyperdrive caching layer" {} \; 2>/dev/null || 
    echo "No document found containing 'Hyperdrive caching layer'"
fi
```
