===== TERMINAL AGENT TEST =====
User Input: Find and analyze the error logs from our API gateway containers that crashed yesterday. First check the standard Docker logs location, but if those are rotated or missing, look for any core dump files in /var/crash, and if that doesn't work, search through our centralized logging system in /mnt/logs/aggregated/. Also, check if there are any incident reports filed about this in our wiki at /wiki/incidents.
Output:
 ## BASH (DOING)

```bash
# Check standard Docker logs location
docker logs --since=yesterday $(docker ps -aq --filter name=api-gateway) 2>/dev/null | grep error

# If logs are rotated or missing, look for core dump files
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    if [ -d "/var/crash" ]; then
        find /var/crash -name "core.*" -type f -print -exec file {} \;
    fi
fi

# Search through centralized logging system
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    if [ -d "/mnt/logs/aggregated" ]; then
        find /mnt/logs/aggregated -name "*.log" -type f -print -exec grep error {} \;
    fi

# Check for incident reports in wiki
if [ -d "/wiki/incidents" ]; then
    find /wiki/incidents -name "*.md" -type f -print -exec grep -i "api-gateway crash" {} \;
