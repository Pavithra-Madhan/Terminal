===== MEMORY AGENT TEST =====
User Input: Hello, Parmira! How can you assist me today?
Output:
 **Evaluation and Processing**

1. **Relevance Evaluation**: The user's message is a greeting, which is considered small talk or filler conversation. Based on the scoring rules, this would be rated as **Low (2/10)**.

2. **Pre-storage Checks**: 
   - **Query Memory STM**: Recent messages in STM do not indicate any specific tasks or topics that require immediate attention or context.
   - **Query Memory LTM**: Long-term facts in LTM do not provide specific information relevant to this greeting.
   - **Comparison**: The new information (greeting) does not add significant value or contradict existing memories.

3. **Storage Decision**: Given the low relevance score (2/10), the message does not meet the criteria for storage in either STM or LTM. **Storage Decision: ignore**.

4. **Tombstone Action**: No tombstone action is necessary as the message does not correct, contradict, or update existing memories.

5. **Output to Terminal Agent**: Since the message is ignored and does not lead to any updates in the memory databases, the structured output reflects this decision.

**Output to Terminal Agent:**

```json
{
  "relevance_score": 2,
  "storage_decision": "ignore",
  "summary_for_LTM": "",
  "memory_db_updated": false,
  "tombstone_action_taken": false,
  "output_for_terminal_agent": "Greeting acknowledged. Ready to assist."
}
```

**Logging**: 
- **Action**: Evaluated and ignored greeting message.
- **Decision**: Message relevance was scored low; hence, it was not stored in memory databases.

**Terminal Agent Notification**: The user has been acknowledged, and the system is ready to assist with further queries or tasks.
