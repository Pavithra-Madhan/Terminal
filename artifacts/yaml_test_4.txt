===== TERMINAL AGENT TEST =====
User Input: I'm getting a 'port 3000 already in use' error when running my React app, 
                  but I also need to check if there are any environment variables missing 
                 from my .env file compared to .env.example, and while you're at it, 
                find any large files (>100MB) in the node_modules that I might want to clean up.
Output:
 To address the user's request, I'll break down the task into steps and use the appropriate tools.

### Step 1: Find the process using port 3000

First, I need to find out which process is using port 3000. I can use the `lsof` command to achieve this.

```bash
lsof -i :3000
```

Let's execute this command using the MCP tools.

```python
import subprocess

# Execute the command to find the process using port 3000
result = subprocess.run(["lsof", "-i", ":3000"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Print the result
print(result.stdout.decode())
```

### Step 2: Compare .env and .env.example files

Next, I need to compare the .env file with the .env.example file to check for any missing environment variables. 

I'll use the MCP tools to read the files and compare their contents.

```python
import os

# Define the file paths
env_file_path = ".env"
env_example_file_path = ".env.example"

# Read the files
try:
    with open(env_file_path, "r") as f:
        env_variables = set(line.strip().split("=")[0] for line in f.readlines() if line.strip())

    with open(env_example_file_path, "r") as f:
        env_example_variables = set(line.strip().split("=")[0] for line in f.readlines() if line.strip())

    # Find missing environment variables
    missing_variables = env_example_variables - env_variables

    # Print the result
    if missing_variables:
        print(f"Missing environment variables in .env: {missing_variables}")
    else:
        print("No missing environment variables in .env")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("One or both files not found.")
```

### Step 3: Find large files in node_modules

Finally, I need to find any large files (>100MB) in the node_modules directory.

I'll use the `find` command to achieve this.

```bash
find node_modules -type f -size +100M
```

Let's execute this command using the MCP tools.

```python
import subprocess

# Execute the command to find large files in node_modules
result = subprocess.run(["find", "node_modules", "-type", "f", "-size", "+100M"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Print the result
print(result.stdout.decode())
```
